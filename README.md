# Your New Favorite Book: Find your next read!

New Favorite is a webite that helps users find their next book to read. Users submit the title of a book that they love and their location to get book recommendations and the location and website of nearby bookstores or libraries. The websites uses TasteDive and Google Maps APIs.

## Use Case
New Favorite is for bibliophiles who enjoy reading and want to make the most of their time. It uses titles that they love to make worthwhile recommendations. New Favorite also finds local stores and libraries so users can find a physical copy of the book today.



## Initial UX
User Stories

* As an initial visitor to the page, I want to land on the web page and see what the page is about so I can understand what the app is and does and decide whether to use it.
* As a visitor, I can submit a book title that I like and a location to get recommendations for my next book to read, dipslayed as thumbnails with titles, and local bookstores or libraries, displayed on a map.
*As a visitor, I can hover on book results to see the discription and click on them to view their Wikipedia page. I can click on the store/libarary pins  to see details of the location, including name, address and website, and visit the store's website.
(LANDING PAGE--wireframe will have title, logo, a few details about how to search and what the app is about)

## Functionality
* When they first set up their account, users are guided through a setup process in which they will be asked to describe an achievement or success they have accomplished and to specify which skills and character traits were required in order to achieve it (for example, negotiation, interpersonal skills, planning, forethought, JavaScript, Python, classical guitar, persistence, juggling). The app will provide users with a default list of general skills and traits from which users can select all relevant ones, and (PLANNED FUTURE ADDITIONAL FEATURE) users should also be able to add and specify their own skills or traits to add to the list (for example, job-specific skills like jQuery or project management).
* Once they have initially set up an account, view their past successes in one or more graphic representations (timelines, charts, graphs, visualizations, word clouds, etc.).
